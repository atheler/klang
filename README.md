# Klang

Block based synthesis and music library for Python.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

We use Python bindings for PortAudio and RtMidi.

### Installing

Klang can be installed via pip or the setup.py. Note that there is a C extension which needs to be compiled (via e.g. clang).

## Running the tests

Tests can be run via:
```
python3 setup.py test
```

### And coding style tests

PEP8 / Google flavored. With the one exception for variable and argument names (`lowerCamelCase`). Function and methods are `written_like_this()`.
